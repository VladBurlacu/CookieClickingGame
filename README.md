Two days project from [BeCode](https://becode.org) where we learn how to create incremental games.

### Goals ###

- [X] Have a basic site that houses the game
- [x] Have a clickable cookie and a visible score/credit count
- [x] Have a store with upgrades
    - [x] Make upgrades cost points
    - [X] Have a passive income upgrade
- [x] Put a click button which will increment a counter and a label initialised at 0 to display said counter.
- [x] In your JavaScript prepare variables to allow you to control your button and label. You will also need a variable to keep track of the score.
- [x] When you click the button, increase the variable storing the score by 1, then display the current score inside the label.
- [x] Add upgrade. When called this button will permanently increase the number of points you gain passively per second.
- [x] The multiplier allows you to have a big score quickly, that shouldn’t be free, it should be a purchase made with the current player score.
- [] Add another button which will act as a multiplier. When called this button will permanently multiply the number of points per click, by two for example.
- [] Display the counter within the multiplier. For example, if the counter is worth 5, then the button should display something like multiplier x5.
- [x] Make it so that each time a upgrade is purchased the cost of buying a new one is increased.
- [x] In the text of the upgrade button you should also have the price of the upgrade.
- [x] Make it so that, if the player doesn’t have the points to purchase a multiplier, an auto-click or an other bonus, he can’t.
- [] Implement yet another improvement to buy, the bonus. It should grant the player a boost in score of 200% per click for 30 seconds. When purchased the player should see a timer with the remaining time inside the bonus button.
- [] Add a save/load game function using cookies.
- [] Your cookie clicker must be pretty, make it look good with CSS or some extra JavaScript.
